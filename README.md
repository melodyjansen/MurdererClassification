# MurdererClassification
Predicting a victimâ€™s relationship to their murderer

In this repository, one can find the code and the dataset that we used for our predictions, along with some more interesting stats and analysis.

The dataset we used consists of over 800,000 US murder cases. Each sample in this dataset tells us of the relationship between offender and victim, as well as other details on the case. This dataset is originally found on http://www.murderdata.org/p/data-docs.html.

To classify the link between victim and offender, we employ both a decision tree and a random forest algorithm. Using statistical analysis we find that our model is not yet accurate enough. This could be due to our features or the methods we utilized; future research will need to look into this further.
